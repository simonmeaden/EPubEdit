A partial set of useful unicode characters.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
Some of the characters have multiple names for the same character. An example is the forward slash character which has two names FORWARDSLASH and SOLIDUS. This is because it is actually called a solidus character in unicode but in many internal programming uses the name FORWARDSLASH is more descriptive of it\textquotesingle{}s actual use.
